            <li class="list">Privacy Concerns: Corrupt companies could try and harvest data from a brain chip like Neurobalance and use it for marketing purposes. This could be especially bad if they could accurately read and control the user's thoughts, emotions and wants.</li>
            <li class="list">Corporate Corruption: Companies could try to buy out Neurobalance or tech like it to make it so they can alter brain chemistry to prefer their product to a competitor by using the neurotransmitters to create positive associations with their brand.</li>
            <li class="list">Safety Risk: Neurobalance would require brain surgery, which means there will always be a potential of something going wrong which could result in severe injury or death.</li>

            <li class="list">Improved mental illness: As is the entire goal of Neurobalance, if it were to be successful, it would make a major step in curing mental illness and improving quality of life for those that suffer from it.</li>
            <li class="list">Improved understanding of the brain: Neurobalance technology would also have the potential to increase our understanding of how the brain works as it studies neurochemicals to solve chemical imbalances. This could open many doors to future innovation in neuroscience and brain chip technology.</li>
