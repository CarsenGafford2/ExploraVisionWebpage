    <ul>
        <li class="list">Augmented reality(AR): Creating a device that could replace the cell phone, and could be combined with brain chip technology to revolutionize fields like entertainment, education, and communication. This idea was abandoned due to lack of room for innovation and new ideas.</li>
        <li class="list">Removable Chip: Creating a removable brain chip with the main goal of putting users at ease since if they ever got uncomfortable with having a brain chip, they could simply remove the device. This idea was set aside in favor of Neurobalance because it was too simple.</li>
        <li class="list">Improved micro AI: Neurobalance would need an improved micro AI that could fit within the tiny brain chip, and reason based on the data sent from the sensors. This could potentially be remedied by hosting the AI externally from the chip itself, though this poses the potential for massive security risks.</li>
        <li class="list">Brain mat design: When deciding on the design of Neurobalance, a mat design that would lay on top of the brain rather than a chip implanted within it was considered, as it is safer and less invasive. This design was dropped once it was determined Neurobalance would have to interact with the Hypothalamus, which is located in the center of the brain and thus unrealistic to accurately interact with it using the mat design.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 700px;">Neurobalance was our best idea because it had the chance to solve the problem we have always fought; our own mental health. We took on Neurobalance because while it would certainly be a challenge, we knew with some effort we could make it happen. We wanted to help people whose daily lives are being negatively influenced by their own minds. We created Neurobalance to help people live their lives in balance one chemical release at a time.</p>
