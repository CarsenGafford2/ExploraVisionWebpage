    <ul>
        <li class="list">Knowledge on how to pinpoint the neurotransmitters responsible for mental disorders: We currently lack consistent research on pinpoint which chemicals are responsible for many mental disorders (Depression, Anxiety Disorders, Bipolar Disorder, etc.).</li>
        <li class="list">Technology to detect and control neurochemicals: Currently we only have the technology  for deep brain stimulation, or modulating the electrical activity, not the chemical activity. This means new technology with the ability to interact with the chemicals would need to be developed. There is already work on this, though, as scientists are currently working on electrochemical sensors, which are close to being able to achieve our goal.</li>
        <li class="list">Improved micro AI: Neurobalance would need an improved micro AI that could fit within the tiny brain chip, and reason based on the data sent from the sensors. This could potentially be remedied by hosting the AI externally from the chip itself, though this poses the potential for massive security risks.</li>
        <li class="list">Surgery Robot: the surgery necessary for implanting Neurobalance would likely have to be done by a robot. The chip needs to go in the hypothalamus, which is located in the center of the brain, and thus would require a level of precision that cannot be safely guaranteed from a human surgeon. Currently, these types of surgery robots do exist, but not for the purposes Neurobalance would need.</li>
        <li class="list">Brain-on-a-chip technology: This is an improved version of an already existing technology capable of simulating clinical trials of toxins by taking cells and testing them rather than actually putting the toxins into the body. Neurobalance would use an improved version of this to simulate how the chip would interact with the brain. This tech would also have potentials in fixing our issues of not being able to detect neurochemicals</li>
